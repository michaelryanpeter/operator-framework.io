      <h1 class="of-heading of-heading--md">Why use the Operator Framework?</h1>
    <p>The Operator Framework makes it easier to build Kubernetes-native applications. It brings the expertise and knowledge of the Kubernetes community together in a single project. The project as a single goal: to lower the high barrier of entry that comes with developing Operators.</p>

        <h2 class="of-heading of-heading--md">For builders and the community</h2>
        <div class="of-section-page-intro__content__columns">
            <p>The Operator Framework offers a standard application package for building and managing Operators. This allows Operator authors and cluster administrators to focus on meeting the needs of their customers, instead of dealing with the many dependencies, prerequisites, and assumptions involved with developing Kubernetes-native applications.</p>
        <p>By sharing the Framework with the community, we want to create an ecosystem of builders. By providing a standardized set of
tools to build consistent applications, these builders can easily create Kubernetes-native applications.</p>
        <p>The Operator Framework is developed with the interests of the community and consumers in mind, because extending Kubernetes should not happen without community participation.</p>

        <h2 class="of-heading of-heading--md">For application consumers and Kubernetes users</h2>
    <p>The Operator Framework addresses the concerns of consumers across the hybrid cloud. It does this by aiding in the creation of cloud-native applications and managing those applications' lifecycles so they are easier to consume, keep updated, and secure.</p>

    <p>Operators come in different maturity levels in regards to their lifecycle management capabilities for the application or workload they deliver. The capability models aims to provide guidance in terminology to express what features users can expect from an Operator.</p>
